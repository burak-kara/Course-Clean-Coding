# Survivor

Here is a game:
In an NxM grid of cells, each cell has 8 neighbors
(except those on the edges). This is a world of survivors.
Cells live or die the next day according to the following
rules:

* A live cell with one or no live neighbors dies.
* A live cell with four or more *live* neighbors dies.
* A live cell with two or three *live* neighbors survives.
* A dead cell with three live neighbors becomes live.
