# Grocery

You're given an implementation of a simple grocery.
Read the digitCode, then refactor it to improve its internal structure.
You're not supposed to add any new functionality.
You may add new methods and classes as you see fit,
to make the digitCode cleaner.
You should do refactoring with the expectation that new product
kinds may be added later.

**Correctness note:**
The output of the original version of the digitCode should be
the same as your final version. If there is a difference,
this means you've introduced a bug.
  
Here is the original output:
